## Create a Service Account
Use the new [Automated Setup Script](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/service-credentials/creating-play-service-credentials) to create a service account for your app. Make sure the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME` is between 6 and 30 characters. 

After the script successfully finishes, download the revenuecat-key.json it generates and upload it to RevenueCat.

The script will also output an email for the service account that you will need to invite in the Google Play Console.
