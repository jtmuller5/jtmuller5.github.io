- Tree traversals (both recursive and iterative)
- BST operations
- Target: 25 problems focusing on tree patterns

**Week 7-8: Graphs Introduction & Backend Basics**
- BFS/DFS implementations
- Basic graph representations
- **Start backend learning**: Database fundamentals, API design
- Target: 20 graph problems + 30 min daily backend study

**Checkpoint:** You should have ~90 problems solved and feel comfortable with medium problems

### Phase 2: Advanced Patterns & Full-Stack Skills (Months 3-4)
**Daily Commitment: 2-2.5 hours**

#### Month 3: Dynamic Programming & Backend Systems
**Week 9-10: DP Fundamentals**
- Start with classic problems (fibonacci, coin change)
- Build pattern recognition for DP
- Target: 2 DP problems daily
- Backend focus: SQL vs NoSQL, caching strategies

**Week 11-12: Advanced Data Structures**
- Heaps/Priority Queues
- Tries
- Union-Find
- Backend focus: Microservices, message queues
- Target: 25 problems + complete a small full-stack project

#### Month 4: System Design Introduction
**Week 13-14: Distributed Systems Basics**
- Study CAP theorem, consistency models
- Load balancing, sharding strategies
- Start "Grokking the System Design Interview"
- Practice: 1 system design problem every 2 days

**Week 15-16: Architecture Patterns**
- Microservices vs monoliths
- Event-driven architecture
- API design (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Frontend-specific: CDNs, browser performance
- Target: Complete 8-10 system design problems

**Checkpoint:** 150+ problems solved, basic system design understanding, backend fundamentals solid

### Phase 3: System Design Mastery (Month 5)
**Daily Commitment: 2.5-3 hours**

**Week 17-18: Full-Stack System Design**
- Design complete applications (e.g., Twitter, Uber)
- Focus on frontend-backend integration points
- Component architecture + API design
- Practice: 1 full system design daily
- Resource: System Design Primer (GitHub)

**Week 19-20: Frontend-Specific System Design**
- Performance optimization (lazy loading, code splitting)
- State management at scale
- Real-time features (WebSockets, polling strategies)
- Accessibility and internationalization
- Target: 15 total system designs completed

**Start scheduling interviews at end of Month 5 for 3-4 weeks out**

### Phase 4: Interview Ready (Month 6)
**Daily Commitment: 2-3 hours**

**Week 21-22: Mock Interview Intensive**
- Schedule 2-3 mock interviews per week
- Use Pramp for algorithms, Interviewing.io for system design
- Record yourself and review communication
- Polish behavioral stories (prepare 10-12 STAR examples)

**Week 23-24: Company-Specific Polish**
- LeetCode Premium: Filter by target companies
- Study company engineering blogs
- Practice company-specific patterns
- Final mock interviews with experienced engineers
- Mental preparation and logistics

## Weekly Schedule Template

**Monday-Friday (1.5-2.5 hours)**
- 6:30-7:30 AM: 1-2 new problems
- Lunch (30 min): Review solutions, watch explanations
- 8:00-9:30 PM: System design or backend study

**Saturday (4-5 hours)**
- Morning: 3-hour problem-solving session
- Afternoon: System design practice
- Evening: Behavioral story writing

**Sunday (3-4 hours)**
- Mock interview (after Month 2)
- Week review and planning
- Catch-up on weak areas

## Key Milestones & Metrics

**Month 1-2:** 
- ✓ 90-100 problems solved
- ✓ Can solve easy in 15 min, medium in 25 min
- ✓ Understand basic backend concepts

**Month 3-4:**
- ✓ 150-175 total problems
- ✓ Comfortable with DP patterns
- ✓ 10+ system designs attempted
- ✓ Built 1-2 full-stack projects

**Month 5:**
- ✓ 200+ problems total
- ✓ 20+ system designs
- ✓ Can design complex systems end-to-end

**Month 6:**
- ✓ 5+ mock interviews completed
- ✓ 10+ behavioral stories polished
- ✓ Company-specific preparation done

## Resource Investment

**Essential Purchases:**
- LeetCode Premium: $35/month × 6 = $210
- Grokking System Design: $79
- Educative.io (1 month for final prep): $59
- 4-5 professional mocks: $800-1000
- **Total: ~$1,150-1,350**

**Free Resources:**
- NeetCode.io for video explanations
- System Design Primer (GitHub)
- Tech Interview Handbook
- Frontend Masters (if you have access)

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Never skip mock interviews** - Schedule your first one at end of Month 2
2. **Track everything** in a spreadsheet: problems solved, time taken, patterns learned
3. **Frontend advantage**: Emphasize your ability to design full user experiences
4. **The 20-minute rule**: If stuck on a problem for 20 minutes, look at the solution
5. **Behavioral prep starts Month 4** - Don't leave it until the end

## Adjustment Points

- **If ahead of schedule**: Add more system design practice (this differentiates L5 vs L4)
- **If behind**: Reduce target to 150 total problems, focus on Blind 75 + system design
- **If struggling with backend**: Extend by 1 month, spend Month 1 purely on backend fundamentals
